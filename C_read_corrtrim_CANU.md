## C. ONT SEQUENCE CORRECTION AND FILTERING WITH `canu`.

`canu` is a program designed to conduct different analyses with ONT data. The program can perform sequence correction, filtering (removal of bases or fragments from sequences with low quality) and assembly. The program **requires a lot of resources for its execution** (this depends on the genome size, complexity and the initial amount of input data used. **The program recommends starting the run with data representing ~20x-60x theoretical coverage (e.g., Sun et al., 2021). The program will run withb lower ammounts of input data but then at the expense of higher error rates (i.e., reads containing higher proportions of miscalled bases).

>The following assemblers were used for the benchmarking, including the long-read only assemblers (Canu [12], Flye [13], Wtdbg2 [14], Miniasm [15], NextDenovo >>(https://github.com/Nextomics/NextDenovo), NECAT [6], Raven [16] and Shasta [7]) and hybrid assemblers (MaSuRCA [17] and QuickMerge [18]). **Canu was not tested on the M. coruscus genome owing to the extremely intensive computing time required for this large genome**. Previous analyses have suggested that using corrected ONT reads could improve the genome assembly [19]. To check the effect that this has on the assemblies, the ONT reads that were corrected and/or trimmed by Canu
