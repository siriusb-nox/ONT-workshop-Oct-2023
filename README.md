## 1. Introduction
This repository contains a tutorial guide to the analysis of raw data derived from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and the initial steps for conducting a genome assembly. Additionally, it includes a real example of ONT data application/usability: e.g., conducting sequence searches on a predetermined database using ncbi blast to determine the identiy of an organism sequenced using ONT. The tutorial is in part based on data generated by Canales et al. (2022, article available [here](https://gigabytejournal.com/articles/71), using a [GridION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/gridion), which was used to assemble the nuclear genome of the cinchona tree (_Cinchona pubescens_, Rubiaceae). For the BLAST demonstrations, unpublished data from a mysterius organism will be used (data produced by Natalia Przelomska, Alexandre Antonelli, Diego Bogarín & Oscar A Pérez-Escobar).

This tutorial is intended for users with a basic knowledge in programming and is designed to run in UNIX environments. The participant should ideally have experience in the use of terminals, and text file management programs such as **awk, sed, grep, among others.**_ The workshop will be run on previously configured computers (Ubuntu 22.04). _A basic introduction to the UNIX enviroment with some useful commands is abvailable [here](https://github.com/siriusb-nox/Taller-Oxford-Nanopore-Dec-2022/blob/main/bash_tutorial.md)_.
